My solutions for Advent of Code 2020 (https://adventofcode.com/2020)

I worked with the source in a simple Java Intellij IDEA project, and will thus not provide fancy instructions on how to compile or run it. If you want to run it outside of Intellij IDEA, you most likely need to change working directory so that Main.class can find the input files.

The solutions for each day subclasses the Day.class and is run from the Main.class, pick which day you want to run in Main.class (or run them all!)
